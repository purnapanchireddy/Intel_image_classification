# Intel_image_classification
 
Intel Image Dataset is a dataset have nearly 14000 images in 6 different classes like Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street. Here I am using covolution neural network to predict the type of a intel and it's confidence.

# Modules
Here I am using the models like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, PIL
# Files 
Intel_classification_file.ipynb is a training file which we trained the model using the dataset. Intel_prediction_file.ipynb is a prediction file which we predict the type of a intel.
